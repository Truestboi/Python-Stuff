You are Sylvester the cat (yea the one from Looney Tunes, deal with it, man) and you really wanna eat that bird
What's his name? Tweet... Twitter Bird. Yeah, I think that's right. Anyways, you are overcome with hunger and it
compels you to throw yourself out of your bedroom window into the garden below. When you land and gain your
bearings, you spot a cave in the distance. At its entrance there is a bat perched upside down from the roof
of the cave. However, as you are about to approach, you realize there is a fox crouching in the bushes behind
you. When you question both creatures on the whereabouts of the social networking bird, they both claim to have
seen him and offer to lead you to him. Who shall you follow?'''

It gives you a narrow-eyed smile and beckons you to follow it through the undergrowth. After a couple of hours of travel, you arrive at a lakeside clearing. The fox turns to you and murmurs \"This is as far as I go, Twitter Bird is beyond this lake,\" and without further delay, disappears into the deep woods. You feel somewhat infuriated that one of your own carnivorous kind would abandon you out of their own natural fear of water, almost to the point of tears.")
    print("\n In front of you sits a rather large boat on the lake, its sail swaying in the gentle breezeself. Just above your head, adjacent to the boat, is a miraculous flying carpet! How it got there, you have no ideaself. However, you don't really care which option is fancier, just as long as it gets you to Twitter Bird.")
